# POS taggers
This project implemenets a first order Hidden Markov Model (pos_tagger.py), and a Keras-based LSTM (lstm_keras.py)
Code for preprocessing is largely the same, with some bloat leftover in the Hidden Markov Model.

I have bundled a French corpus from [Universaldependencies](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_French-GSD/tree/master) used to train both models.
